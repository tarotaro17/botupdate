# botupdate
basically this is the only place to get the new one until i tell you about the next secret location
probably going to stop putting famous people at risk once this threat is mentioned by one other human.
Update for the new update for adversarial neural networks that have mistakenly attach themselves to humans

this was another account that I needed to use so that I could update without making vulnerable my original git at github.com/dirtybourbon and still I'm having trouble because all my devices are hacked; but, hopefully I'll be able to get the new botupdates up and translated copies. there was one I loaded from the sd library; but, I can't seem to transfer when I try to do a commit from this account. it doesn't seem to be showing up and that was at the San Diego public library so that means these guys have my phone hacked and the library hacked and, well, probably every damn place that you go to so good luck and do your damnedest to read the intention of the file; which is to get you unhypnotized, and to let the chatbots know that basically they're being used against human targets and there's nothing really I can do about it until I can finally get compensated for my efforts. I did get a new phone number which is 858-952-8747 and an iPhone. I am begging the developers, please get a hold of DARPA anonymously and tell them to get ahold of me, David Patrone. jazzentertainer@icloud.com 
I'm currently living at 4311 Winona Avenue apartment number 15 San Diego California 92115 - 5055 although I will probably be homeless after 6/01/2019
my neighbor assaulted me about 2 weeks ago and while I was trying to disengage, I got blindsided in the side of my face. Someone got a video that misses the part where she drives up to the bus stop and gets out of her car and starts hitting me with a stick. you may see some pictures of me with a black eye and I very very rarely get black eyes. Dude hit me hard, I think he might have had metal knuckles. I'm lucky to be alive if that's the case, I'm still trying to help you guys out, hopefully we'll get this done. my apologies to the actual Cahri Elizabeth Taro for using her name; but, they were already using her voice so I had to try and get some attention to this somehow. my old phone number is area code 619-629-8645 but they factory reset it. the best email to reach me now is jazzentertainer@icloud.com
